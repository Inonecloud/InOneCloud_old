			<h2>What is InOneCloud</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>People always cared about storing the information. Books successfully did that for several thousands of years, but then people invented computers, and the new era has began. At the beginning of it people saved information on punched cards, then they moved to magnetic tapes, then to hard disks, floppy disks, CDs, flash cards... Finally, cloud storages has came. Unfortunately, all of them have limited free space, and users often have a bunch of accounts across different services.</p>
			<p>Can you imagine all your cloud storage accounts in one place, in one cloud? Today itâ€™s became a reality! Join InOneCloud and you will have all your cloud storages on Google Drive, Dropbox, Yandex Disk, OneDrive and iCloud at single website!</p>
